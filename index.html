        than two immediate supervisors. When information and tasks and given, it is disseminated from the top-down. When
        something is requested, it is "passed up" the chain. When a problem arises, cadets are highly encouraged to go
        through their immediate supervisor for help, rather than "jumping the chain" and asking someone higher up. This
        is
        to minimize the number of questions and problems for those higher up in the chain-of-command.
